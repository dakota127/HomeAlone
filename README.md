Home Alone Monitor
Version 2 of 'Switch Lights When Not at Home' with Raspberry Pi
This is a much extended version of the old switcher that was published in 2015. It acts as a IoT Gateway.

This documentation describes a gadget based on ESP32 that monitors movements of peole living alone.
It is basd on an idea that I found on YouTube. Ralph Bacon presented his device using an ESP8266 and heavily borrowed from his ideas.
Hoever, I felt that I wanted to use an ESP32 to make used of the multitasking capabilities of this chip.

I used the Arduino IDE to develop the software. Hardware is based on the Adafruit Feather series of boards.

Check out the project description for all the details.
